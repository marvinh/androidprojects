In my implementation for the face detection of head nodding yes or no I started
of following a presentation of the face detection tracker and tutorial presented
by Google Mobile Vision: https://developers.google.com/vision/face-detection-concepts.

By following the document I was able to quickly get started setting up a camera with a
FaceDetector and FaceTracker to begin testing head nods.

Through this presentation I found that axis in which the head rotates left and right
is called EulerY and used this figure to given to me through the FaceTracker which is
sort of a listener for the FaceDetector and found values that would act as a threshold.

The implementation of the detection is as follows. sideCount keeps track of head nodding left
and right vertCount keeps track of a head nodding up and down as best as I could acheive it because
there is no Euler axis for tracking the movement of a head up and down.

int sideCount = 2;
        int vertCount = 2;
        String str = "Status";
        float startingpoint = 0.0f;
 @Override
        public void onUpdate(FaceDetector.Detections<Face> detections, Face item)
        {





            //System.out.println("Euler Y: "+ item.getEulerY() + "Euler Z: "+ item.getEulerZ());


            //System.out.println("POSY: "+ item.getPosition().y);



            if(vertCount == 2)
            {
                startingpoint = item.getPosition().y;
                vertCount = 1;
            }

            if(vertCount == 1)
            {
                if(startingpoint < item.getPosition().y)
                {
                    startingpoint = item.getPosition().y;
                    vertCount = 0;
                }
            }

            if(vertCount == 0)
            {
                if(startingpoint > item.getPosition().y)
                {
                    str = "Shaking head up and down";
                    vertCount = 2;
                }
            }

            if(item.getEulerY() >= 12.0)
            {
                if(sideCount == 2)
                {
                    sideCount = 1;
                }else if(sideCount == 0){
                    str = "Shaking head right left...";
                    sideCount = 2;
                }
            }

            if(item.getEulerY() <= -12.0)
            {
                if(sideCount == 2)
                {
                    sideCount = 0;
                }else if(sideCount == 1){

                    str = "Shaking head left right...";
                    sideCount = 2;
                }

            }

            runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {

                    TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.trackText);
                    textView.setText(str);

                }
            });

            System.out.println(str);
